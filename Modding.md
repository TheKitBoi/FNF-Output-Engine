dont use trace if you are debugging in html5 instead at the top of the file you want to debug put "import flixel.FlxG" then wherever you want to debug just do 'FlxG.log.add("whatever you want")'
also make sure you put things in these: "" or '' if you want to log/print/trace things into the log or any string arguments
